A Pi calculator based on the colliding blocks experiment in [3Blue1Brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dTyOl1fmDo), [Original paper](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf)

Note: due to limitations of 64-bit floating numbers, this only works with ratio up to 10^8

I may modify this to improve the process
